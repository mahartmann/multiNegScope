# Multilingual Negation Scope Resolution for Clinical Text
This repository contains code for identifying negation scopes in multilingual clinical data using a transformer-based multilingual language model (mbert), as described in the paper [Multilingual Negation Scope Resolution for Clinical Text](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2021.louhi-1.2.pdf) (LOUHI 2021).

The code in this repository is a re-implementation of the original code that was used for the negation scope resolution experiments described in Paper. The original code is based on the [mt-dnn](https://github.com/namisan/mt-dnn) framework, and it was re-implemented in order to make it less complex. If you want to obtain the code that was used for the experiments in the paper, please contact the authors at mrkhartmann4@gmail.com

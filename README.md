# Multilingual Negation Scope Resolution for Clinical Text
This repository contains code for identifying negation scopes in multilingual clinical data using a transformer-based multilingual langauge model (mbert).


The code in this repository is a re-implementation of the original code that was used for the negation scope resolution experiments described in Paper. The original code was based on the mt-dnn framework, and it was re-implemented in order to make it less complex. If you want to obtain the code that was used for the experiments in the paper, please contact the authors at mrkhartmann4@gmail.com
